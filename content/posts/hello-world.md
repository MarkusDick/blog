## About me

Hello Internet,

I'm Markus and this is my first blog post! I wanted to have a blog for a long time. Now I thought I'd get started. It doesn't really matter which theme or static site generator I use, just start. And here we are. I'm trying to get over my "perfectionism" and just release and **__finish__** things. Because I love open source, you can find the source code for this blog [here](https://github.com/markusdick/blog). The blog uses the static site generator [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the theme [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). The [turtle favicon](https://icons8.com/icon/klZZJQYqaSjN/turtle) is from Icons8.

In my freetime I love learning new things.

## Education
- apprenticeship as an IT specialist for application development (Fachinformatiker/in f√ºr Anwendungsentwicklung)
- currently studying computer science

## Work
- working fulltime as a devops/software engineer at a local waste recycling company

## Hobbies and interests
- learning new things!
- "speed" cubing üê¢ (I still need to learn 2-Look OLL and 2-Look PLL)
- board games (thanks to family ‚ù§Ô∏è)
- using open source software / hardware
- tinkering with technology and since a few months ago with electronics
- reading
- I would like to get into 3d printing and machine learning

## Why this blog?
I want to share and document my progress and the things I'm learning. Of course, I'm not an expert in all these areas, just a person trying to solve some problems and learn something new every day. If you have suggestions on how to do things better, you can grab my code and improve my code, or open an issue and discuss technical issues with me. This is the beauty of open source.

You can also dm me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/balkonbewohner) or send me an [email](mailto:blog@markusdick.de).
